# flappy_ai
I will try to teach custom neural network on python to play flappy bird

-TAB key switches modes:
  1. Collect data, don't learn
  2. Collect data and learn

-UP/DOWN keys - set FPS to 3600/60

-L key - load weights. Repository contains successfully trained weights

-S key - save weights. You can try to train a brand new network :)
